## Availablity
I'm available immediately.

## CV

For contracts, I'm open to most opportunities.

For permament roles, I'm looking for a role with a good team and to work for a company where I appreciate the product, the product servers a useful purpose and the business model appears to be viable commerically. As most of the above is subjective, I'm happy to start a discussion.
