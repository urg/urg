## CV

For contracts, I'm open to most opportunities.

For permanent roles, I'm looking for a role with a good team and to work for a company where I appreciate the product, the product serves a useful purpose and the business model appears to be commercially viable. As most of the above is subjective, I'm happy to start a discussion to explore possibilities.
