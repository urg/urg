## Company Intro:

so-sure is a MGA offering mobile phone insurance direct to consumers.

## Project Details:



My time at so-sure went through several stagees.

Initially my focus at so-sure was on creating the MVP, where I hired the app developers, and created the backend for the initial product (architecture, infrastructure, api, and admin portal). I also sourced the payment provider and integrating the backend with them. And I spent quite a bit of time working with our underwriter and claim handlers to definite the data transfer format and do integration testing.

After MVP launch, we quickly discovered that mobile first did not work well for aquiring customers and quickly went to a web based purchase flow. During this time, we were focusing on growth and implemented Mixpanel tracking and A/B testing to rapidly test ideas. 



## Team Composition & My Role:

I was the first technical hire at so-sure. I created the majoring of the backend systems and api, along with all of the infrastructure. I hired the technical team, including 2 native app developers, 1 front-end dev, & 2 backend devs. I worked closely with the MD, Head of Product, & Head of Marketing as well as the underwriter and the claims team.
