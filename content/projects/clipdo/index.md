## Company Intro:

clipDO was a system for sending website content to your kindle using browser extensions and/or bookmarklets. Additionally, there was a social media 
aspect where you could discover content on the site as well as comment on content to your friend group. clipDO ceased trading after 1 year.

## Team Composition & My Role:

I was the technical co-founder of clipDO. I architected the site and developed some of the functionality. I hired and lead 2 developer at clipDO.

## Project Details:

The project had 2 main aspects:

#### Core Product

The MVP consisted of sending content to your kindle. We had an api that would scrape the provided website, extract the content out as simplified html, add a cover page, and finally send to your kindle. Additionally, we developed Chrome & Firefox browser extensions as well as a bookmarklet for use on mobile.

#### Social Media

We had a hybrid model that combined both the Twitter (public commentary) & Facebook (friend group commentary) models. You could discover content that other people had sent to their kindle (provided they allowed it) and make comments about the content for discussion.
