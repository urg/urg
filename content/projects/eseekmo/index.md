## Company Intro:

eSeekMo is an idea I had to help streamline my processes when communicating with recruiters. There are several application tracking systems (ATS) 
available for companies, however, I was not able to find anything that helped candidates. 

## Team Composition & My Role:

eSeekMo is my own project.
