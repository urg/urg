## Company Intro:

eSeekMo is an idea I had to help streamline processes and workflows when communicating with recruiters. There are several application tracking systems (ATS) available for companies, however, I was not able to find a similar product that helped candidates. 

## Team Composition & My Role:

eSeekMo is my own project.  I did the initial site in react/redux and later worked with a junior front-end developer to improve the 
look of the site.
